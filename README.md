## About the Physics Resource Hub

In this project, we intend to provide a platform to accumulate many resources and information that we thought would have been better if they were available to us before we were preparing ourselves for a research career in physics. Neverthless, they have turned out to be highly useful for us. We are using this platform to provide a single stop to find the otherwise scattered online learning resources. This initiative is carried out by the Alumni and Faculties of the Department of Physics, Government College, Madappally, Vadakara.

Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Just The Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) theme.
